<H1>Shoebox Utilities</H1>
<P>These Shoebox utilities were developed back in the days of
Shoebox. They are equally useable with the newer Toolbox and most of
the tools have been updated to handle Unicode data. For the sake of
discussion, this manual will talk in terms of Shoebox as including
Toolbox unless otherwise stated.</P>
<P>This manual also breaks the golden rule of manual writing: Never
let the programmer write the manual. My apologies and if anyone would
like to offer a better one, I am very open to contributions.</P>
<H2>Installation</H2>
<P>ShUtils is distributed as a .exe program which is an installer. To
install, run this program and follow the installation instructions
included. If in doubt, just accept each of the default values
offered.</P>
<P>Due to a problem with updating the path on your computer. It is
advisable to reboot after installation.</P>
<H2>The Programs</H2>
<P>All the programs are command line based programs and should be run
from a command prompt.</P>
<H3>Sh2xml</H3>
<P>SH2XML is a program to convert Shoebox/Toolbox data to XML. It
automatically creates an XML document structure from the database
type hierarchy of standard format markers. It also analyses
interlinear text and breaks this into interlinear blocks in the
output XML rather than leaving it as lines of text.</P>
<P>Since XML is a Unicode based file format, it is necessary to
convert the standard format data used by Shoebox into Unicode as the
XML file is being created. If the data is already in Unicode (as may
happen in Toolbox) then that conversion is easy. Other encodings are
harder, but SH2XML provides a mechanism to do this conversion easily
and simply.</P>
<P>Each field in a Shoebox database has an associated language
definition. This language includes such information as possible sort
orders, default font, etc. In effect the language definition includes
information regarding the encoding of the data. For a Unicode based
encoding, SH2XML will identify this automatically. Likewise, if no
other information is given, the default encoding (usually the system
encoding, which is usually codepage 1252), is used for conversion.
But often legacy data needs a more sophisticated conversion to
Unicode. This conversion can be done via a Windows codepage number or
a TECkit binary mapping.</P>
<P>SH2XML interacts with text conversion via an install once, use
anyway, mechanism whereby mappings are installed on a user's system
and then are referenced by name rather than needing to know about
paths to specific mapping files. To set up the database of mappings
and to install new mappings, see the section on the encrem program
later in this manual.</P>
<P>SH2XML identifies the particular mapping name to use from
information in the language definition.
